one-liner for installing NVM (Node Version Manager) on macOS, and then installing Node.js:

```bash
curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.38.0/install.sh | bash && source ~/.bash_profile && nvm install node
```

This command is doing a few things:

1. `curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.38.0/install.sh | bash`: This part downloads the NVM installation script and executes it. Replace `v0.38.0` with the latest version number if it has been updated.

2. `source ~/.bash_profile`: This loads the NVM scripts into your current shell. Note that the specific command will depend on your shell. If you're using bash, this command is fine, but if you're using zsh, you should use `source ~/.zshrc` instead.

3. `nvm install node`: This installs the latest version of Node.js.

After running this command, you should have NVM and Node.js installed. You can check your Node.js version with `node -v`.

Do remember to restart your terminal after the installation to make sure changes are properly reflected.

Also, be aware that the specifics might change if the NVM installation instructions are updated after my knowledge cutoff in September 2021. Always refer to the official NVM repository for the most up-to-date instructions.
